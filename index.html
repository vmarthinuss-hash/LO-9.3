Each year, vast volumes of plastic waste are discharged into the oceans, where they undermine biodiversity and destabilise fragile marine habitats. Owing to the extreme durability and slow degradation of plastic materials, their persistent accumulation generates long-term ecological consequences that disrupt natural food webs and compromise the overall balance of marine environments." },

Numerous species inadvertently ingest plastic debris, mistaking it for food, which can result in internal injury, malnutrition, or fatal blockages. Moreover, as larger plastic items fragment into microplastics, toxic chemicals are able to enter marine food chains, increasing the risk of bioaccumulation and posing significant threats not only to wildlife but also to human health through the consumption of contaminated seafood." },

Measures such as limiting the production of single-use plastics, strengthening waste management infrastructure, and promoting environmental education can substantially reduce the volume of plastic entering marine ecosystems. Ultimately, meaningful progress depends on coordinated and sustained action by governments, industries, and individuals, ensuring that responsibility for environmental protection is shared and that marine ecosystems are preserved for future generations." }
